To compile run: Make

All clients should be in separate directories and must contain at least one file each besides the 
executable. 

It was easier for me to just copy the executable into all the client directories after compiling.

My files are listed a little differently than instructed but still easy to read, the structure
is like so:

	filename || filesize || ID ::  || ip || port

All files for the same client are listed on one line with the ip and port at the end. Double colons separate
files and the ip and port from files.

My system can hold a maximum of 10 clients by definition in the program. This can be changed easily by editing the MAX_CONNECTIONS variable in the header files. Also, there is a maximum file size of 2048. I didn't think to make a global variable defined in the header till too late for that, that was sloppy I apologize.

Everything works well. Sometimes the server bugs out when closing a client with control-C, this only happens sometimes and even after hours of GDB debugging i couldn't figure out what the source of the problem was. The exit commmandworks smoothely though.
